The goal is to use as many languages as I possibly can as a small challenge to myself.

## What is the advent of code?
The Advent of Code is a seasonal challenge to developers to attempt to complete different challenges during the month of December. See their about page [here](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about). See available challenges [here](https://adventofcode.com).
